# Where's Randall?

Where's Randall is a simple HTML/CSS/JS website that is used to help Super Smash Bros Melee players with their Randall timings. Randall is a cloud platform that moves around below the main platform on the Yoshi's Story Stage.

The video below shows the Yoshi's Story Stage, and at the bottom you are able to see our buddy Randall.

## Randall Timing

Knowing your Randall timings can save you from losing a stock (a life) in the game. Knowing when you are able to use Randall can help save you from being edge-guarded.
