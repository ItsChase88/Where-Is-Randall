# Where's Randall?

Where's Randall is a simple HTML/CSS/JS website used to help Super Smash Bros Melee players with their Randall timings. Randall is a cloud platform that moves below the main platform on the Yoshi's Story Stage.

## Randall Timing

Knowing your Randall timings can save you from losing a stock (a life) in the game. Knowing when you can use Randall can help save you from being edge-guarded.
